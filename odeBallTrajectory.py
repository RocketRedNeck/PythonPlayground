odeExample - example of integration of ordinary differential equations in the
             form of an understandable physical system that can be visualized
             by middle and high school students

    Equations of motion of a shot put and plastic-like ball with drag in 
    2-dimensions
    
    NOTE: We won't be modeling the actual plastic ball aerodynamics, just the
    mass and diameter as it is effected by simple drag on a sphere.
 
    Definitions
    -----------
        px = x-component of position
        py = y-component of position
        vx = x-component of velocity --> dpx/dt
        vy = y-component of velocity --> dpy/dt
        ax = x-component of acceleration --> dvx/dt
        ay = y-component of acceleration --> dvy/dt
    
        Fx = x-component of drag force
        Fy = y-component of drag force
    
        Cd = drag coefficient
        rho = air density
        A = cross section area
    
        m = mass
    
        g = acceleration due to gravity
    
        SIMPLIFY: Cd, rho, A and g are constant                    
        SIMPLIFY: Cd and A are directionally invariant (i.e., a sphere)

        REALITY: g(p) is gravity as a function of position
                 rho(p) is density as a function of position
                 A depends on the direction of flow across the body being 
                 considered
                 Cd depends on the speed and direction of flow across the body 
                 being considered
                 i.e., Cd depends on a value known as the Reynolds number (Re), 
                 which is a ratio of inertia forces and visous forces
                     Re = v*rho*l/mu
                     l is a reference distance
                     mu is a viscosity coefficient
                     
                FORTUNATELY, the Cd is constant over a wide range of Re for
                a sphere (i.e., ~0.5 from Re about 10^3 to 10^5)
                
                See: https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/dragsphere.html
                
                Interestingly: http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/WWW/faculty/plawsky/Comsol%20Modules/plastic/WiffleBallAerodynamics.pdf
                
                Without the assumptions we would have to model Cd(Re(v)), which
                we may do in a second version of this example.
    
        q(v) = Dynamic pressure as function of velocity = 0.5*rho*v^2
        F(v) = Drag force as function of velocity = -(|v|/v)*Cd*A*q(v)
              i.e., Drag is in the opposite direction of velocity

    Equations
    ---------
        dpx_dt = vx
        dpy_dt = vy
        dvx_dt = F(vx)/m        Remember F= m*a --> a = F/m
        dvy_dt = F(vy)/m - g
       
        Make it pythonic by assigning 
            
            p[0] is px
            p[1] is py
            v[0] is vx
            v[1] is vy
        
        Represent as a single state vector:
            
            s[0] is px
            s[1] is py
            s[2] is vx
            s[3] is vy
            
        Create a function of the following form:
            
            ds = f(t,s)
            
            where
            
            ds[0] = s[2]            | These are the equations
            ds[1] = s[3]            |
            ds[2] = F(s[2])/m       |
            ds[3] = F(s[3])/m - g   |
                        
        Continue on to the code below to see how to run a simulation of this
        system of equations
