# IP Addresses are used by the network hardware to route traffic
# It is just like having a house address or zip code
# In networks the interface hardware is assigned an IP address to
# make the interface unique within the network.
# In the IPv4 standard IP addresses contain 4 bytes representing
# layers to the local network. Usually, the address is represented
# as a string containing '.' as a delimeter for readability
#
# Examples:
#   Some addresses are special, defined in various standards to mean
#   specific things to the network (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses)
#
#   The standard loopback address (talk to self) is '127.0.0.1'
#
#   A typical Ethernet router (gateway) at '192.168.0.1' will assign your 
#   PC something like '192.168.0.2', '192.168.0.3', etc. although sometimes the
#   '10.x,x,x' range is used.
##
#   '255.255.255.255' is reserved to broadcast to all nodes on the network
#
#   '224.0.0.0' to '239.255.255.255' is reserved for multicast
#
IF_ADDR = args.addr

# Ports are a way of distinguishing the type of information traffic on a
# netowrk. The port is simply a logical distinction that allows traffic to
# be routed to one or more sockets that care about the information.
#
# Like IP Addressses, some ports are reserved (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)
# and should not be arbitrarily used for other purposes as this could create
# confusion in the applications that are expecting the traffic.
#
# 0 to 1023 are "well known"
# 1024 to 49151 are "registered"
# 49152 to 65535 are "dynamic" and may be assigned by user applications
#

# then we will let the system assign connections to a new port to
# keep traffic separated

    # object. All network traffic to the address and port will signal

    # The interface address can be a specific IP address associated
    # with network interface hardware or we can request that the
    # first interface found is used (IP_ANY). In some environments
    # IP_ANY is '0.0.0.0', in this environment the empty string has
